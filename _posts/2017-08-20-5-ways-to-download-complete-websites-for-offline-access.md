Sometimes you need to have access to a website’s data while offline.  Maybe you’d like a [backup of your own website](https://www.technorms.com/4806/take-online-snapshot-of-any-page-with-backupurl "Easily create a Cached copy of any Webpage with BackupURL") but your hosting service doesn’t have an option to do so. It may be the case that you’d like to imitate how a popular website is structured or what their CSS/HTML files look like. Whatever the case there are a few ways you can download a part of or a complete website for offline access.

Some websites are too good to simply linger online that’s why we’ve gathered 5 tools which you can use to easily download any website right to your local PC, similar to our guide about [backing up your Twitter account](https://www.technorms.com/16014/backup-twitter-archive-downloading-computer "Backup Your Twitter Archive By Downloading It to Your Computer").

The programs we mention below can serve this purpose very well. The options are straightforward enough that you can begin downloading an entire website in just a couple of minutes.

## Download Partial or Complete Website for Offline Access

### HTTrack

![Download-websites-with-HTTrack](/assets/images/image1198.png "Download websites with HTTrack")

[HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/ "Learn more about HTTrack") is an extremely popular program for downloading websites. Although the interface isn’t quite modern, it functions very well for its intended purpose. The wizard is easy to use and will follow you through settings that define where the website should be saved and some specifics like what files should be avoided in the download.

For example, exclude whole links from the site if you have no reason to extract those portions.

Also, specify how many [concurrent connections](https://www.technorms.com/24822/disable-max-limit-set-simultaneous-network-connections "Disable the Max Limit Set on Simultaneous Network Connections") should be opened for downloading the pages. These are all available from the **“Set options”** button during the wizard:

If a particular file is taking too long to download, you can easily skip it or cancel the process midway.

When the files have been downloaded, you can

[open the website](https://www.technorms.com/8028/automatically-open-sites-in-incognito-mode-chrome "Want to Open Specific Sites in Incognito by Default? Ghost Incognito Can Hel") at its root using a file similar to this one here, which is **“index.html.”**![Download-websites-with-HTTrack](/assets/images/sshot-1179.png "Download websites with HTTrack")

## Getleft

![Download-websites-with-Getleft](/assets/images/sshot-2101.png "Download websites with Getleft")

[Getleft](http://sourceforge.net/projects/getleftdown/ "Learn more about Getleft") has a new, modern feel to its interface. Upon launch, press **“Ctrl + U”** to quickly get started by entering an URL and save directory. Before the download begins, you’ll be asked which files should be downloaded.

We are using Google as our example, so these pages should look familiar. Every page that’s included in the download will be extracted, which means every file from those particular pages will be downloaded.

![Download-websites-with-Getleft](/assets/images/sshot-385.png "Download websites with Getleft")

Once begun, all files will be pulled to the local system like so:

![Download-websites-with-Getleft](/assets/images/sshot-564.png "Download websites with Getleft")

When complete, you can [browse the website](https://www.technorms.com/1113/keyboard-navigation-lets-you-easily-browse-webpages-in-chrome-with-keyboard "Keyboard Navigation Lets You Easily Browse Webpages In Chrome With Keyboard") offline by opening the main index file.

## PageNest

![Download-websites-with-PageNest](/assets/images/sshot-922.png "Download websites with PageNest")

[PageNest](http://pagenest.com/index.html "Learn more about PageNest") reminds me a bit of both HTTrack and Getleft combined. Enter the address of the website to download in the

**“Address”** tab from the main page upon program launch. You’ll be asked for the essentials like the name of the site and where it should be saved.

## Wikipedia Dumps

![Download-Wikipedia-Dumps](/assets/images/image1200.png "Download Wikipedia Dumps")

Wikipedia [doesn’t advise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#Please_do_not_use_a_web_crawler "Wikipedia: Please do not use a web crawler") users to use programs like those above to download from their site. Instead, they have **Dumps** we can download [here](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/ "Download Wikipedia dumps"). For example, here are dumps for October 28th, 2013:

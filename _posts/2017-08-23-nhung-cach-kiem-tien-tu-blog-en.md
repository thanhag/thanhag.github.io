## 4\. Blogging

Hey look, an article about making money online that doesn’t mention blogging. . . oh wait, here it is.

First off, I’m a blogger so it seems wrong not to mention it, but more importantly, it’s a legitimate way to make money. It’s quite possibly the least straight-forward way on this list, but it’s very doable and it’s also quite possibly the funnest way on this list. I love blogging and I know hundreds of bloggers who feel the same. So let’s talk about making money blogging and what it really means.

Blogging is something that requires patience, persistence and discipline. It may mean writing everyday for over a year before you really start to see any money from it. There are exceptions to the rule, but from my dealings with other bloggers, it seems to be pretty common to spend one or even two years building your blog, your brand and your authority, before making any serious amount of money.

Some people argue that you can make money without a lot of traffic and while that is true in some circumstances, you will generally need a lot of website traffic to start earning from a blog and that takes a while. Once you’ve reached that point, here are the primary ways to monetize your blog and start earning:

1. 1. **Advertising** – This is definitely the most old-school way of earning money with a blog. It’s also starting to become the least common way. You can sell advertising spots directly on your site or you can sign up with a company like [Google AdSense](http://google.com/adsense) or [Media.net](http://media.net/). Either way, you won’t see a whole lot of money from ads until your views are well into the thousands each day.

1. 1. **Affiliates** – There are many affiliate networks, such as [FlexOffers](https://www.flexoffers.com/)and [CJ Affiliate](http://www.cj.com/) that allow you to promote other people’s products and services. You simply put a link or a banner on your page and then you get a percentage if someone clicks through and buys the product/service. You’ll want to select products that are specifically within your blog’s category.This is an effective way to earn money once you have the traffic coming to your blog.
    2. **Membership** – Many people have created a paid membership area on their blog. This is typically for exclusive content that you can only access in the “member’s area.” If you have a really great idea on what to include, this can be a great idea.  You’ll have to create something that can’t easily be accessed around the web.
    3. **Products** – You can create your own product, such as an ebook or computer software. You would then use your blog as a promotion tool to get people to buy your product. As long as you create a legitimate product with a whole lot of value, you should be able to get some buyers, but like everything else with a blog, you’ll need the traffic to get the sells.
    4. **Services** – You can offer a paid service, such as life coaching, blog coaching, goal setting or financial planning. Just be sure to investigate all the legal implications and make sure you’re not claiming to be a professional if you’re not one. With a service like this, you’re basically using your blog to sell yourself. You’ll need to convince people that you’re worth buying and then be able to back up your claims once they purchase your service.

1. **Sponsored/paid posts** – Many blogs publish sponsored and paid posts. Sponsored posts are basically just posts about a specific brand, product or service. A company will pay you to publish an article about it. It’s similar with other paid posts as well. Your basically selling the spot for the article on your site. If you decide to take this route, you’ll want to build your traffic before you will get many offers.
2. **Subscription** – If you think of something valuable (newsletter, online magazine, etc.) that you can consistently offer on a certain basis (weekly, monthly, etc.), you may want to offer a subscription service. This could be a fee charged each time your product is sent out or on a monthly basis. Either way, this has to be something that your customers can only get by subscribing to your website.
3. **Videos** – This could be an entire section on it’s own. Many people have made money by creating YouTube videos. [Evan of EvanTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/EvanTubeHD) is a kid and [he has made millions](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/money/wanna-millionaire-learn-from-these-12-kids-who-already-are.html) by creating reviews of products that other kids his age would use. It’s not easy to get views into the millions, but once you do, you’ll start seeing some cash come in. Many bloggers have completely turned to videos to get their point across by starting a video blog.

If you’re truly interested in becoming a blogger, start by looking through the archives of [ProBlogger](http://problogger.net/), [Copyblogger](http://copyblogger.com/blog) and [Boost Blog Traffic](http://boostblogtraffic.com/). Then go read through all the free guides over at [Quick Sprout](http://www.quicksprout.com/blog/). It may take you a year to complete those tasks alone, but it will be worth it. You’ll practically have a MBA in blogging.

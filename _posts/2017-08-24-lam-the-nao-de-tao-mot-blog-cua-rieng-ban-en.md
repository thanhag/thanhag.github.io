Do you want to start a blog? If so – you’re in the right place.

In this post I want to walk you through the basics of how to start a blog, and while I do, I want to answer some of the basic technical questions that many pre-bloggers need to answer to get their first blog up and running.

There are many reasons to start a blog, but the challenge that faces all aspiring bloggers (including me back in 2002) is: how to start a blog?

## 5 Easy Steps

There are a few simple steps that you will need to complete to start your blog:

1. Choose your blogging platform
2. Secure a domain name and get hosting in place with [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/problogger/)
3. Configure your blog
4. Design your blog
5. Start creating useful content that serves readers

Below I’ll walk you through how I’d approach each step if I were to start a blog and suggest further reading that will be helpful on other important questions like: choosing a niche, finding readers for your blog, building community with your blog, and thinking about how to make money from it, etc.

My hope is that this step by step starting guide will help you to start your first blog.

## Step 1: Choose a Blogging Platform

To start a blog you’ll need to select a blogging platform – or a tool that helps you to get your content up onto the web.

There are many blogging platforms available but in my mind the choice is clear and simple. I would set up straight away on a WordPress.org site, and I highly recommend you do too.

WordPress is by far the most popular blogging platform and for good reason –

- It is free to use (although you do need to make a small investment in a domain and a server – more on that below)
- It is easy to set up
- It has been around for many years and is a robust and secure system (although you do need to keep it up-to-date to maintain security)
- It has a whole industry of tool providers, designers and developers around it that will help you to customise your blog in many ways

Keep in mind that WordPress offer two tools:

1. [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) – where they host your blog, look after the back end, and give you access to have it on their own domain. It’s free to start but, you pay to upgrade different elements of it.
2. [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/) – where you have complete control and host the blog on your own server, your own domain and have complete control over how it looks, operates and how you can monetise it. It is completely free to use but you need to arrange your own hosting, domain etc.

WordPress.com is easier to set up and means you don’t need to keep upgrading versions of WordPress but it gives you less control over your design, how you monetise and what features you can add. WordPress.com is free to start with but depending upon what upgrades you want to get it can end up being just as expensive as WordPress.org.

My recommendation is to go with WordPress.org – you’ll have a little more work in the setting up phase (I’ll walk you through it below) but in the long run you’ll have full control over the look, feel, features and monetization of your site. It could end up cheaper for you too!

I know some of you are probably searching for advice on how to start a blog for free and so my advice to invest a little in a WordPress.org blog might not be exactly what you’re looking to hear because there are some small costs associated with it – but you’ll be better off in the long run and as you’ll see below the expense is not great.

## Step 2: Secure a Domain Name and Set Up Your Blog Hosting

I recommend using [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/problogger/) for getting both your domain and hosting set up.

### Choose a Domain

For the next step of starting your blog you’ll need a domain name (your blog’s address) so that you have a home for your blog online. Here on ProBlogger my domain name is www.problogger.com – every blog needs its own domain, so it can be easier said than done to find one that isn’t taken!

For the sake of this article I just want to talk about how to technically get your domain – but there are a few other factors to consider including:

- **The Human perspective** – readability of your domain, the ease of it to say and remember, etc
- **The Brand perspective** – uniqueness, what the domain says about you
- **The SEO perspective** – choosing a domain with good keywords can help your site rank higher in Google
- **The Legal perspective** – copyright and trademark factors

We cover all four of these areas in our post [4 Things to Consider when Choosing Your Domain Name](https://problogger.com/4-things-to-consider-when-choosing-your-domain-name/). I would highly recommend reading that post before you go out and grab a domain.

Depending upon where you get your domain and which domain you choose, a domain isn’t a super-expensive thing to secure – but it will cost you at least a few dollars a year.

### Set Up Your Blog Hosting with Bluehost

Perhaps the simplest way to get your domain is to do so with the same place that you get your blog hosted. My recommendation for a good place to start is [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/problogger/).

WordPress has been recommending Bluehost for blog hosting since 2005. With 1-click WordPress installation, 24/7 support, and a super affordable rate, Bluehost is a great option for building your first website or blog.

**Special Offer for ProBlogger Readers**: As I write this article, [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/problogger/) have an offer exclusive to ProBlogger readers to get set up for just $2.95 USD per month (including a domain name!). This is a 63% saving.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Blog

If you’ve gone with Bluehost as your domain and hosting provider, installing WordPress is super simple. In fact Bluehost have created a simple video to show you exactly how to do it:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyH98Dmcfqc" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>

If you have any trouble during this process, they have a live chat support system which enables you to ask questions of their support team.

Note: other hosts including inmotion have similar simple install systems for WordPress but if you run into trouble WordPress have an [installing WordPress page too here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress).

Once you’ve completed this process, you now have a WordPress blog installed! You started a blog! Congratulations – you’re almost there!

## Step 4: Configure and Design Your Blog

If this is your first experience of WordPress you might be looking at the dashboard and wondering what you’ve done by installing it – it feels overwhelming doesn’t it!

Don’t worry – you’ll pick this up in no time and just need a good walk through!

### Configuring your blog

Luckily the team at [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/problogger/) have put together a great series of tutorials that will help you with becoming used to WordPress and also setting things up to make your blog look and operate just right.

Here’s a good video that introduces you to what you’re looking at on your WordPress dashboard.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J0WTjhSi0eM?list=PL_9u00nsHteH2OBVX4YSU_HWWY_JSxFyj" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>

And here is another on creating categories and tags for your blog:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYy9n-nmnM0?list=PL_9u00nsHteH2OBVX4YSU_HWWY_JSxFyj" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>

One of the most powerful things in WordPress is that it allows you to install and use plugins to get extra functionality on your blog. You might want to save this one to watch later but it will help with making your blog more feature rich.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmpoAC9HhRQ?list=PL_9u00nsHteH2OBVX4YSU_HWWY_JSxFyj" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>

### Designing your blog

Another thing you’ll want to do now is to think about your blog’s design. First impressions count for a lot so you’ll want one that says something about the type of brand you’re trying to create and that helps you stand out in the crowded blogosphere.

Bluehost have a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlpSSSXRThk&list=PL_9u00nsHteH2OBVX4YSU_HWWY_JSxFyj&index=7) that shows you the basics of setting up and choosing a design theme but can I echo the advice in the video about investing in a ‘premium theme’ for your blog.

While there are many thousands of free themes out there, this is an area that it can be well worth investing in.

Last time we surveyed ProBlogger readers, we found that most ProBlogger readers agree with this, and have premium themes as the basis of their blog designs. While they will cost you to buy, if you get one from a reputable source they’ll be secure, fast, have good search engine optimisation, will be designed for mobile as well as desktop, and be easy to install and customise.

**\>> Podcast: [How to Decide on a WordPress Theme for Your Blog](https://problogger.com/podcast/119-2/)** _with graphic designer and developer Kelly Exeter_

The premium theme supplier that I have used over the years and highly recommend is [StudioPress](https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=346199&u=286361&m=28169&urllink=&afftrack=) (aff). I’ve used their themes in the early days of numerous blogs and love their design but also support.

If you’re looking for a really easy solution, check out the new [**StudioPress Sites**](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=965900&u=286361&m=28169&urllink=&afftrack=), a fully hosted, all-in-one WordPress website builder that will give you:

- **The Genesis Framework** – Industry Standard Design Framework that makes WordPress easier, without sacrificing power or flexibility
- **20 Mobile-Optimized HTML5 Designs** – sleek professional designs that provide beautiful frames for your content
- **Fast Loading Cloud Performance** – cloud infrastructure that’s optimized specifically for peak WordPress performance
- **Zero “Hosting” Hassles** – with a fully hosted website that will grow with you and your website traffic
- **One-Click Install of Included Plugins** – Never wonder which plugins are trustworthy, thanks to your StudioPress Site’s repository of one-click solutions for the functionality you desire.
- **Rock-Solid Security**
- **Advanced SEO Functionality**
- **Automatic Plugin and Theme Maintenance** – Many WordPress site owners spend $$$ every month to have an outside service keep things updated and safe.
- **World-Class Support** – friendly support team standing by 24/7

To be honest – the design part of setting up a blog is the bit I find hardest. It is definitely possible to do it 100% yourself (and there are many tutorials around that will help you learn the skills to do it) but for 99.9% of new bloggers a theme that you tweak is the way to go.

The other option if you’re super serious is to hire a designer to do a custom design for you. But that is likely to cost you some significant cash to get a reputable designer and so a them is probably the best place to start.

Don’t stress too much in the early days – we all start with a design that we later look back on and cringe a little at. The main thing is to get set up and evolve from there. My key tip is to choose a simple, classic and clean design that you can add a simple logo to to make it a bit more individual and then get on with blogging!

## Step 5: Start creating useful content that serves readers

OK – hopefully by now you’ve got your domain, hosting, have installed WordPress and have your theme installed. You have started a blog… but you’re not a blogger until you start creating some content for your blog!

I can’t really tell you what to write on your blog for your first post – because it is something that will vary a lot from blogger to blogger – but I’ll share some links below that might help give you some starting points.

What I can point you to is a couple of helpful videos from our friends at Bluehost again.

There are two types of content that you are able to create for your blog in WordPress – ‘Pages’ and ‘Posts’.

### Pages

Pages are the ‘static’ pages on your blog that won’t really change that much but which you’ll link to from your menus and navigation areas on your blog. For instance here on ProBlogger my ‘[About Page](https://problogger.com/about-problogger/)’ and ‘[Speaking Page](https://problogger.com/speaking/)’ are created using a ‘page’.

Your first page should probably be an ‘About Page’ – a page which tells people about you and your blog. It’s a page you’ll want to show up in your navigation area/menu and is going to get quite a few people read it to understand what you’re about as a blogger.

Need help with your about page – check out our previous post on [what to include in your About Page?](https://problogger.com/random-blog-tip-include-an-about-page/)

### Posts

Posts are a little different and what you’ll spend most of your time creating as a blogger – they’re where you create your regular blog posts. Posts will appear on the front page of your blog once they’re published. They usually have comments and a date to show readers when it was published.

Let’s start by creating an ‘About Page’. It’s easy to do – in fact if you know how to use a word processor like Word then you should be ok!

Here’s exactly who to do that with our friends from Bluehost:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9s8aYsSNtjk?list=PL_9u00nsHteH2OBVX4YSU_HWWY_JSxFyj" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>

Next it is time to write your first blog post.

Once again the content is going to vary a lot from blog to blog but how you get that post up onto your blog is a relatively simple process and one that you’re going to become a master at in no time!

In fact you’re going to find this process very similar to creating a ‘page’ for your blog. Here’s a last video from Bluehost on creating ‘posts’.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0C55PU-8xE?list=PL_9u00nsHteH2OBVX4YSU_HWWY_JSxFyj" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>

## Further Reading on Creating Content for Your Blog

There’s a great deal more that you could read about starting a blog but the process above should get you going. Once you’ve worked through it here are a few other suggested articles to read to help you take your next steps.
